#### STEP 1: CREATE A GITHUB REPOSITORY ####

# Go to your github account and click the button to create a new repo. I typically do not initialize with the .gitignore, readme.md, or license.md files, but add them myself manually after the project is up and running.

# Setting up Git with RStudio:
    # https://jennybc.github.io/2014-05-12-ubc/ubc-r/session03_git.html
    # https://cfss.uchicago.edu/setup/git-with-rstudio/



#### STEP 2: ENABLE GIT IN RSTUDIO ####

  # 1) Open your project in Rstudio and navigate to Tools -> Version Control -> Project Setup

  # 2) Click SVN/Git tab and select git as the version control system. It will ask you to initialize a new git repo and restart Rstudio

  # 3) After Rstudio reopens, confirm that there is a Git tab in the environment pane (which for me, and I think by default, is in the upper right of the IDE)



#### STEP 3: SYNCHRONIZE WITH THE GITHUB REPO ####

## Open a terminal and do the following:

# move to the project directory
cd Projects/website

# initiate the upstream tracking of the project on the GitHub repo
git remote add origin https://github.com/hansenjohnson/website.git

# pull all files from the GitHub repo (typically just readme, license, gitignore)
git pull origin master

# set up GitHub repo to track changes on local machine
git push -u origin master



#### STEP 4: PUSH FILES TO GITHUB ####

# Click the Git tab in Rstudio, and then click Commit. This will open a window where you can stage files to be tracked (and synced on GitHub). Select all the files you would like to track, write a commit message, then click push. This will send all changes to the GitHub repo.



#### STEP 5: UP AND RUNNING ####

# All you need to do now is remember to commit changes and push them to the GitHub repo. Don’t forget!



#### BONUS: REMOVING A TRACKED DIRECTORY #### 

# I inevitably track a folder that I’d prefer to keep off of GitHub. That directory, hypothetically called /public for this example, can be easily removed using:
git rm -r --cached public
# Then commit the changes, push, and you’re all done!
```
